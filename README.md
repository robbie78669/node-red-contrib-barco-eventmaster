# node-red-contrib-barco-eventmaster

The *node-red-contrib-barco-eventmaster* module adds support to [Node-RED](http://nodered.org/) for sending and receiving JSON-RPC messages to Barco Event Master devices.

This then makes it easy to bridge between other protocols, for example OSC.

## Installation
